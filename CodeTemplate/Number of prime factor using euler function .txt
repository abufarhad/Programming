##****How Many Factor Pairs Does a Given Number Have?***##

Hi BJ,

Well, it won't tell you there are 12 pairs since there are in fact 16
(you left out 7,24 and 12,14 and their negatives), but here's the
algorithm that will give the correct answer:

Look at the exponents on the prime factors.  In your example, they are 
3, 1 and 1:  168 = (2^3)(3^1)(7^1).

Take all the exponents, add 1 to each, and multiply the numbers:

(3 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4*2*2 = 16

There's the answer unless the number happens to be a perfect square in 
which case you need to add 1.

Here's why it works.  I'll just explain for your example, and you can 
see why it'll always work.  Let's begin by making a list of all the 
factors.  The factor will have some number of powers of 2 in it 
between 0 and 3: (0, 1, 2 or 3).  Thus there are 3 + 1 = 4 choices for 
the number of factors of 2.  Similarly, there are 0 or 1 factors of 3 
and 0 or 1 factors of 7.

Once you choose the number of each of the prime factors in your
divisor, you know what that divisor is.  There are 4 ways to choose
the number of factors of 2; 2 ways to choose the number of factors of
3 and 2 ways to choose the number of factors of 7, so there are 4*2*2
= 16 factors.
